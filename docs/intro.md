# GitAds: Fueling Open Source

Welcome to the official documentation for **GitAds** â€” the premier advertising platform designed specifically for the open-source ecosystem.

## What is GitAds?

GitAds connects open-source maintainers with relevant advertisers, creating a sustainable funding model for open-source projects while providing companies with direct access to engaged developer audiences.

:::tip Why GitAds?
GitAds was created to solve the sustainability challenge in open source. We believe maintainers should be rewarded for their contributions while preserving the integrity and user experience of their projects.
