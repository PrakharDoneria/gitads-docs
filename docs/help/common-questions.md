## General Questions

### What is GitAds?
GitAds is an ad-serving platform that helps open-source GitHub repositories monetize by placing ads in their `README.md` files. It is designed for developers and open-source maintainers to easily earn revenue while promoting relevant ads.

### How do I sign up for GitAds?
To sign up, visit our [registration page](https://gitads.dev/publisher/register) for publishers or [advertiser registration](https://gitads.dev/advertiser/register) to get started.

### What types of ads can I run as a publisher?
GitAds serves banner ads that include both text and images. These ads will be displayed in your repository's `README.md` file.

### How are ads placed in my repository?
You will need to add a small piece of code into your `README.md` file after verification, and your ad will appear automatically.

## For Publishers

### How long does it take to verify my GitHub repository?
Verification is usually instant. If it takes longer than 10 minutes, ensure that you've correctly followed the verification steps and are using the right repository branch.

### Can I remove the verification code after verification?
Yes, once the repository is verified, you can safely remove the verification code from your `README.md`. The ad will still appear.

### How do I receive payments?
Publishers must complete a quick KYC process. Payments are issued to verified accounts, and the payout methods depend on your country and preferences.

## For Advertisers

### What is the minimum budget to start an ad campaign?
There is no strict minimum, but we recommend starting with at least $20 to ensure enough exposure.

### How do I target specific GitHub repositories?
GitAds provides filtering options to target specific categories of repositories (e.g., frontend, backend, tools, etc.).

### How do I track my ad performance?
Once your campaign is live, you can track impressions, clicks, and click-through rates (CTR) through the GitAds dashboard.

### What happens if I exceed my budget?
If your budget runs out, your campaign will automatically pause. You can add more funds to continue running the campaign.
